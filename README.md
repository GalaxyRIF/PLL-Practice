In welcome page we have the following instructions:
    '使用说明'
    'S键：生成存档，R键：读取存档'
    'X键：记入识别失败'
    '其他任意键：启动/结束计时'
    '最后一列的数字是失败次数'
Which means:
    Instructions:
    S for saving records, R for reading
    X will save the failures
    Other keys will start/end time.
    
    
 Each time one PLL appears on screen, press any key other than x when you recognize which PLL it is. If you fail to recognize press x to record this failure.
 It will calculate average time of indentifying each single PLL and print it on the screen.
